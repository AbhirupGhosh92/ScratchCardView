# ScratchCardView

This is a custom view which emulates a scratch card. The view can hold drawables as well as solid colours as scratchable surfaces. The scratch radius is also customisable. Furthermore , the paint dismisses elegantly after user has partially scratched the card.

The user can overlay this view over any other android view and watch the magic happen.
